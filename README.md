Code for Template based Graph Neural Network with Optimal Transport Distances (NeurIPS 2022)

We are currently working on a factorised implementation with a pipeline compatible with the user-defined GNN pre-processing architecture. You can find an exemple with GIN pre-processing, as set by default in the paper, in the supplementary material shared during the reviewing process. Link: [vanilla implementation](https://openreview.net/attachment?id=seYcx6CqPe&name=supplementary_material).
